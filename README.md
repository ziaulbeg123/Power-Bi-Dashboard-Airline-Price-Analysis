# Power-Bi-Dashboard-Airline-Price-Analysis

I recently completed an interactive Power BI dashboard on airline ticket pricing using a dataset of more than 300,000 rows.
Key Insights Visualized:

Bar Chart → Average price by airline (compare carriers on pricing trends)
Stacked Column Chart → Class-wise price distribution (Economy vs Business)
Line Chart → Days left vs average price (impact of early booking on cost)
Map Visualization → Flight routes (source city to destination city)
Scatter Plot → Duration vs price (segmented by airline)
Donut Chart → Stops distribution (Non-stop, 1 Stop, 2+ Stops)
KPI Cards → Average Price | Maximum Price | Minimum Price | Total Routes

Learnings:
Prices increase significantly as the travel date gets closer, which shows that early booking saves money.
Business class has a consistent premium, while economy prices are more volatile.
Some airlines offer cheaper long-duration flights compared to competitors.
Non-stop flights are generally more expensive than connecting flights.

Skills Applied:
Power BI (data modeling, DAX, interactive visuals)
Data storytelling with large datasets
Turning data into insights for airline pricing strategy
